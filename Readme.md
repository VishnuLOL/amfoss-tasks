# Introduction

___

Hey, I'm Vishnu. I like coding and tech but may not come as addicted to them as I already have a lot of other addictions, you can see them if u look at my screen time. 

When I'm not glued to a screen, you can see me hanging out with friends, window shopping and doing all kinds of uncool stuff. I'm excited to meet new ppl and dive into their business even if I'm a nuisance to them.


## Why should we choose you?
___
I'm not gonna take my time writing all the glibbery glabbers just because you asked me for an intro. You should do an interview to find out what I can do tho its not that much. 


## What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?
___
* I would like to increase my knowledge of how the coding world works and would love meeting new people and furthering my vision and networks. 
* I will increase my coding skills starting from beginner tutorials and increasing all the way to where I can call myself an intermediate in that language or stream...


## How will you contribute back to the club?
___
And when it comes to giving back to the club, count me in! I'll share what I learn, help out with projects, and maybe even organize some game nights or coding challenges. As for the praveshan process, let's spice it up! How about adding some game-like quests or cool demos to show off what the club is all about? Let's make joining the club feel like unlocking a new level of awesomeness!!!
