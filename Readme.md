Hey, I'm Vishnu. I like coding and tech but may not come as addicted to them as I already have a lot of other addictions, you can see them if u look at my screen time. 

When I'm not glued to a screen, you can see me hanging out with friends, window shopping and doing all kinds of uncool stuff. I'm excited to meet new ppl and dive into their business even if I'm a nuisance to them.

I'm not gonna take my time writing all the glibbery glabbers just because you asked me for an intro. You should do an interview to find out what I can do tho its not that much. 

And when it comes to giving back to the club, count me in! I'll share what I learn, help out with projects, and maybe even organize some game nights or coding challenges. As for the praveshan process, let's spice it up! How about adding some game-like quests or cool demos to show off what the club is all about? Let's make joining the club feel like unlocking a new level of awesomeness!!!
