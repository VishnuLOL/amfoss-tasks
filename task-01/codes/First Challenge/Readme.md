First I used cd to get into 06 directory then used cat to view Spell_05.txt then went to spellbook using cd and then used python3 but couldnt run the code. Then used gedit to view the python file and got the code....
**aHR0cHM6Ly9naX**

Then after checking the code changed the code to print this output..
*Vishnu J (@VishnuLOL), you are about to use the Impedimenta spell. Are you sure this is the right one? If yes, then the secret code associated with it is: aHR0cHM6Ly9naX*
